 * mean a streaming answer re-renders without remounting — so the fade plays when the message first

 *
 * TRANSFORM AND OPACITY ONLY, so the scroller can still measure. `MessageScroller` sizes items and

 * a message can fade in without moving the thing the scroller just measured.
 *
 * The full transform string rather than motion's `y` shorthand: the shorthand is not hardware
 * accelerated and drops frames exactly when the main thread is busy, which here is while a reply is
 * streaming.

 * must not wait behind anything, so `delay` is zero for it. Opening a channel is the one moment the
