 * size cap, or the rule that the password never appears in anything anybody reads.
 *
 * NO SESSION IS KEPT. A connection is opened, used and closed for every listing, every read, every
 * search and every send. A pooled IMAP session would be a long-lived authenticated socket that
 * several Bots' calls arrive on, which is the shape of bug `mcp.ts` declines to have. IMAP is worse
 * for it than HTTP, because a session carries SELECTED-mailbox state, so one call's `mailbox`
 * argument would silently decide what another call read.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODULE IS NOT. It makes no decision about whether a call is allowed, whose it is, or
 * what a model should be told. It speaks the two protocols and hands back plain values.
 * `plugins/builtin-mailbox.ts` holds the tools, the argument checking and the sentences; the split
 * is the same one Routines has between `routines/store.ts` and `plugins/builtin-routines.ts`.
