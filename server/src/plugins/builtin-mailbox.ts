/**
 * The builtin transport for the Mailbox: a Bot reading and answering the deployment's mail, without
 * leaving the building.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT FROM ROUTINES, the other builtin. Routines has no credential at all,
 * because it acts on this deployment's own tables and the ACTOR is the authorization. This one does
 * have a credential, a mailbox password, and it is the deployment's rather than anybody's: there is one
 * mailbox, every Bot granted these tools reads the same one, and no person consents to it. So the
 * authorization here is the GRANT: an administrator decides which Bots may read the mail and which
 * may answer it, per tool, on the Plugins page, exactly as they would for a vendor's connector.
 *
 * That is why nothing below reads `connection.actorId` as permission. A run that reaches here has
 * already passed the grant check and the policy decision in `plugins/store.ts`, and there is no
 * per-person narrowing left to do: the mailbox does not have somebody's half.
 *
 * THE PASSWORD IS NEVER IN THE ENVIRONMENT and never in an answer. The hosts and the accounts come
 * from `config.ts`; each account's password comes from the encrypted credential vault, as that
 * account's own credential, resolved through {@link MailboxAccess.password} at the moment a call
 * needs it and thrown away after. {@link redacted} is the last line of that: a failure sentence
 * from a mail server that echoed the login back is scrubbed before anybody reads it.
 *
 * SEVERAL ACCOUNTS, ONE DEPLOYMENT. `support@`, `sales@` and `billing@` on the same shared host are
 * one configuration with one host pair and a password each. Which one a call works in is the
 * `account` argument, defaulting to the first configured. It changes nothing about the access
 * model: the accounts are all the deployment's, the grant is still per tool rather than per
 * account, and a Bot granted these tools reaches every one of them.
 *
 * It implements the same interface as every other transport, as module-level exports, because that
 * is the shape {@link ./transport} resolves: a `TransportKind` maps to a MODULE. Which is also why
 * the configuration and the vault arrive through {@link useMailbox} rather than a constructor: the
 * registry is built at import time, long before `index.ts` has either.

 * its error message, so the credential can arrive here inside somebody else's words. That text goes
 * into an audit row and in front of a model, and neither is a place for the mailbox password.
 *
 * THE BASE64 FORMS ARE NOT PARANOIA, they are the common case. Neither client prefers plaintext
 * `LOGIN`: imapflow authenticates with `AUTH=PLAIN` when the server offers it and falls back to
 * `AUTH=LOGIN`, and both put the credential on the wire base64-encoded. So a quoted command carries
 * `base64("\0user\0password")` or `base64(password)` rather than the password as typed, and a
 * redaction that only knew the plaintext would pass it through unchanged while looking like it
 * worked.

 * address goes in the wrong one. Left to the mail server it comes back as "Character not allowed in
 * mailbox name: '.'" and then "Mailbox doesn't exist: support", which are sentences about IMAP
 * folder naming that no model turns into "use the other argument". Said here, the fix is in the
 * refusal.
 *
 * THE LOCAL PART IS THE SECOND HALF OF THE SAME MISTAKE, and it was made live: refused an address
 * in `folder`, the model retried with `support`, then `webmaster`, which are the parts before the @
 * of two configured accounts. That is not an address any more, so the check above lets it through,
 * and the mail server answers "Mailbox doesn't exist: support", which reads as a folder that is
 * merely missing rather than as an argument that is wrong. A folder genuinely named after an
 * account's local part is possible and is given up here on purpose: the mistake is common and the
 * collision is not.
 *
 * `mailbox` is still read as a name for the same argument. This connector shipped with that key,

 * silently ignored and read INBOX while believing it read Archive. Both checks cover it either

 * learn a vocabulary lesson, and live runs show the FIRST mailbox call of a turn making this
 * mistake, so the lesson is paid for before any work happens. So the address is taken as the
 * account, the folder falls back to {@link DEFAULT_FOLDER}, and the answer says what was done. The
 * note teaches the same lesson the refusal did, on the way past rather than instead of the work.
 *
 * WHAT IS STILL REFUSED, because neither is unambiguous:
 *
 * - An address in `folder` that is NOT a configured account. There is nothing to adopt: the model
 *   is asking for a mailbox this deployment does not have, and guessing which one it meant would
 *   read somebody else's mail to answer a question about a mailbox that is not there.
 * - `folder` holding one configured address while `account` names a different one. Two arguments
 *   naming two mailboxes is a model that has lost track of which it is reading, and picking either
 *   would be picking for it. The refusal names both.
 *
 * The local-part refusal in {@link selectFolder} is deliberately left alone. `support` is not an
 * address, and a folder genuinely called `support` can exist, so adopting it would be guessing
