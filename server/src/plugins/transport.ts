/**
 * How this deployment reaches one vendor: which protocol, chosen per catalogue entry.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Every connector used to be MCP, so "the transport" was an import. Google's Drive
 * MCP server turned out to be gated behind a developer preview, and the same product's ordinary REST
 * API is generally available — so one vendor needed a second way in, and a second way in wants a
 * seam rather than a branch at each call site.
 *
 * The interface is MCP's OWN, unchanged: `listTools` and `callTool`, the two functions
 * {@link ./mcp} already exported, with the shapes it already used. That direction matters. Had the
 * REST adapter been given its own interface with MCP adapted to fit, MCP would have become a special
 * case of a shape invented for Drive. As it is, MCP is the contract and the adapter conforms to it,
 * which is why swapping back is one field on one entry and not a refactor.
 *
 * There are exactly two call sites in the whole system — the tool listing and the tool call — and
 * both take a transport from here. Nothing else, including the OAuth flow, the per-person credential
 * selection, the grants, the policy engine and the audit trail, knows which protocol is underneath.

   * and nobody to ask it of.
   *
   * It is on the transport rather than assumed by the caller because getting it wrong is a whole
   * broken setup flow. Assumed true, an administrator configuring Drive was sent to their own
   * settings page to connect a personal account, purely so a token could be minted, passed to a
   * function that ignores it, and discarded — then sent back to press refresh. Nothing about that
