/**
 * Tool selection, asserted on the bytes that reach the model rather than on the decision.
 *
 * The unit tests next door prove `selectTools` narrows correctly. They cannot prove the narrowing
 * arrives: the tools are attached at agent construction, the runtime clones the agent before every
 * run, and both of those sit between the decision and the request. So this drives the real
 * `buildAgents`, through a real clone, against `@copilotkit/aimock` — ours, the org's deterministic
 * backend — and reads the tool list out of the request the mock actually received. If the agent were
 * built with the whole catalogue, or the clone lost the wrapper, or pass one never happened, the
 * decision would still be right and every one of these would fail.
 *
 * Both paths are covered because they attach tools differently and would break separately: a
 * built-in Bot carries them in its configuration, a remote one is sent them in the AG-UI run body.
